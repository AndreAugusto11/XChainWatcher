XChainWatcher is a pluggable monitoring and detection mechanism for cross-chain bridges, powered by a cross-chain model. It uses the [Souffle Datalog engine](https://souffle-lang.github.io/) to identify deviations from expected behavior defined in terms of cross-chain rules.

Here's an example of a basic cross-chain transaction rule:
```
ValidCCTX_Rule1(asset_id, tx_hash_A, tx_hash_B) :-
    Transaction(A, tx_hash_A, timestamp_tx_a),
    Transaction(B, tx_hash_B, timestamp_tx_b),
    LockAsset(asset_id, tx_hash_A),
    MintAsset(asset_id, tx_hash_B),
    timestamp_tx_b > timestamp_tx_a + Î´
```

This rule defines a valid cross-chain transaction where an asset is locked on one chain and minted on another, with appropriate time constraints.

### Key Features
1. Monitoring of cross-chain transactions
2. Detection of attacks and unintended behavior in cross-chain bridges
3. Analysis of transaction data from multiple blockchains
4. Pluggable design for integration with various cross-chain bridges

### Key Findings
Our analysis using XChainWatcher has revealed:

* Successful identification of transactions leading to losses of $611M and $190M USD in the Ronin and Nomad bridges, respectively.
* Discovery of 37 cross-chain transactions that these bridges should not have accepted.
* Identification of over $7.8M locked on one chain but never released on Ethereum. 
* Detection of $200K lost due to inadequate interaction with bridges.

See the full paper for details. These findings demonstrate the critical need for robust monitoring and analysis tools in the cross-chain bridge ecosystem.

### Requirements
* [python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3115/): `brew install python@3.11` (tested with python 3.11.5)
* Virtualenv: `pip install virtualenv`
* R (to create and visualize figures): `brew install r`. To install required R packages, run `sudo Rscript -e 'install.packages(c("ggplot2", "scales", "dplyr", "gridExtra", "patchwork", "tidyr", "lubridate"), repos="https://cloud.r-project.org")'`.
  
### Setup
1. Create a file `.env` from `.env.example`: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Populate env vars, namely `MOONBEAM_API_KEY` ([you can obtain a free api key at onfinality](https://app.onfinality.io)), and `BLOCKDAEMON_API_KEY` (([you can obtain a free api key at Blockdaemon](https://app.blockdaemon.com/))). You may set `SOURCE_CHAIN_API_KEY`and `TARGET_CHAIN_API_KEY` to the same value as `BLOCKDAEMON_API_KEY`.
3. `brew install --HEAD souffle-lang/souffle/souffle`
4. python3.11 -m venv xchainwatcherenv
5. source xchainwatcherenv/bin/activate
Full installation procedures, including for other OSs [is available in the official installation page](https://souffle-lang.github.io/install).
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Usage
ðŸš¨ Ronin related analysis is WIP (we are uploading the datasets) ðŸš¨



#### Figures
To generate figures, run each corresponding R script in `analysis/figures`, for instance `Rscript analysis/cctx-breaking-finality-nomad.R`.

### Data
This project includes the first open-source dataset of over 81,000 cross-chain transactions across three blockchains, capturing $585M and $3.7B in token transfers in Nomad and Ronin, respectively.

Datasets can be found under different folders. For Ronin and Nomad, respectively: raw data can be found in `cross-chain-rules-validator/analysis/ronin-bridge/data` and `cross-chain-rules-validator/analysis/nomad-bridge/data`. Datalog engine runs can be found in `cross-chain-rules-validator/datalog/ronin-bridge/results` and `cross-chain-rules-validator/datalog/nomad-bridge/results`. Datalog facts can be found in `cross-chain-rules-validator/datalog/ronin-bridge/facts` and `cross-chain-rules-validator/datalog/nomad-bridge/facts`.
